### ABOUT

CS50 Finance empowers users to 'buy' and 'sell' stocks and track changes over time with easy-to-read analysis. 
CS50 Finance was written for CS50x, a introduction to Computer Science and Programming. 

The prompt and specifications can be found at [Harvard's CS50 website](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/psets/9/finance/)

### Getting Started

Code is not adapted to work outside of the [CS50's IDE](https://ide.cs50.io/)
You will have to get your own API code from the [Investor Exchange](https://iexcloud.io/docs/api/)

### Self-Reflection
As a beginner's work, there is a great deal of unnecessary repetition in this program.

Commenting style is inconsistent due to experimentation.  

### Re: Specifications
A "personal touch" was requested. My personal touches include:
1) a "popular stocks" function to /buy
2) provided a version of the index in the /sell.html.
3) provided additional information based on gains/losses based, including features that were missing on Robinhood at the time. 
on the average cost of previous purchases vs. the current price.

### Citations
Some of the code is by the cs50 staff and/or taken from Flask documentation.
